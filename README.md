# CS-33 Comp Graphic and Visualization

# How do I approach designing software?
Software​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ design is a process that I mentally outline starting with conceptual planning and problem decomposition. In my opinion, taking a complex objective and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable systems which can be separately developed and later integrated is a very effective approach. Here, the 3D scene was a set of interdependent modules, for instance, texture handling, lighting setup, and geometry rendering. I was able to develop and test each component separately without the need to interact with the rest of the system by restructuring the application in this manner. Furthermore, I choose designs that make the system extensible and understandable which would allow it to be possible for new shapes, materials, or lighting effects to be added without any ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌​‍​‌​future.

This​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ project has been a great exercise for me to sharpen my skill of visualizing and creating 3D models from 2D images. I figured out the way to break down a single reference image into basic geometric figures like spheres, cylinders, and planes. Besides that, I went further into the theory and practice of how light, material properties, and color can make a scene look more realistic. The creation of a straw hat was a matter of making the shapes work together and choosing the right scaling and rotation to fit the curves of the original photo. I gained more control over my spatial reasoning and also improved my capacity to challenge myself intellectually when it comes to 3D composition and ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌form.

The​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ design strategies that I implemented here are just as effective when used in future projects that are related to 3D modeling, simulation, or game design. When I start with decomposition and abstraction, it becomes possible for me to convert complicated visuals of the real world into 3D assets that are of a manageable size in an efficient manner. Additionally, the practice of modular scene planning enables it to be a simpler way for collaborators to interact with a project and for the developers to do the maintenance in a larger software project. These methods will be great assets for me not only in graphics programming but also any software engineering work that involves the need to juggle the aspects of creativity, logic, and ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌structure.

# How do I approach developing programs?
While​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ programming, I usually employ modular and iterative methods. My emphasis is always on producing neat and understandable codes whereby the logic is distinctly divided into different units of the code. Thus, SceneManager.cpp file in this particular project is a good example how the file has been refactored to divide key systems such as texture creation, lighting configuration, and model rendering into dedicated methods. It not only bettered the organization but the time for debugging and testing was also prolonged considerably. Moreover, I commit myself to the principle of adaptability in my development method whereby it is still possible to change the values such as light position, material shininess, and scale without the need of rewriting a large portion of the ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌code.

I​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ achieved this project by rolling out a few new approaches that brought me a much better understanding of contemporary graphics programming. To handle transformations and rotations, I opted for the GLM (OpenGL Mathematics) library, which cut down the 3D matrix calculations drastically. Further, I used the STB image library to load textures dynamically and applied them through shader, based material mapping. These techniques gave me a great deal of freedom to recreate the surface of the Luffy’s hat that looked like a straw texture. Moreover, I started to use lighting models with variables to make the rendered scene look more real and have a greater ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌span.

Iteration​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ was the main point throughout the whole creation process. I went through it step, by, step by first drawing simple geometric figures without textures or lighting, and then slowly I brought in materials, colors, and rotations to get a nicer visual. After every iteration, I would render the scene and decide what changes to make according to the results. This method allowed me to fix alignment problems, adjust scale, and照亮 the lighting intensity. Frequent iteration enabled me to make sure that each level of development was a continuation of the previous one, thus resulting in a final neat work which reflected the visual I had in ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌mind.

My​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ programming style has evolved from being procedural to a more structured, object, oriented one. Initially, I was only concerned with the scene rendering correctly. After that, I concentrated more on organizing, reusing, and clarifying my code. I had rewritten functions to make them less redundant, used more descriptive variable names for transformations, and had more methods for setting materials and textures. In the final stage, my turnaround time was significantly quicker, and I had built a reusable framework for other 3D graphics ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌projects.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
By​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ providing me with the necessary technical background, Computer Science is one of the ways that I can still my creative ideas. I can make interactive experiences from scratch by programming, which is 3D modeling, game design, or software development. My understanding of the complex problems increases as I work on these kinds of projects, thus I become more confident. What is more, it is creative art and computational logic which, when they are combined, produce something valuable and can be ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌seen.

Computational​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ graphics have opened my eyes to the fact that math, physics, and programming are one and the same when it comes to visual media. Things like matrix transformations, lighting calculations, and shader programming are just as relevant in graphics as they are in simulation, data visualization, and computer vision. Besides, these skills will be a solid footing for me in my future courses in game development, graphics engines, AI, assisted rendering, and the like. Such a journey will enable me to keep extending the limits of what I can create and ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌build.

On​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ the professional side, my knowledge of computational graphics has equipped me with the capabilities necessary to be in any industry where visual realism and user, interactivity are the core requirements. Knowing how to render 3D objects efficiently, handle textures, and set up lighting systems are great skills that can be used in game creation, AR/VR apps, and simulation engineering. Besides that, the skill of data visualization and creating graphical interfaces is something that can be used in any technical position. This undertaking has not only increased my technical skills but has also been a great reminder of my passion for creating visually immersive and technically reliable ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌applications.
